      <h4>About This Project</h4>
    </header>
    <p>
      Hello! This is my first javascript project that I have worked on. This
      project was created to demonstrate how to use array, run conditions
      against each array element, and produce an answer visible to the user
      utilizing HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are few aspect of the challenge regarding this project. Learning how
      to interact with alert and refresh the page at the same time. How to
      import HTML values into array. Creating loops that works with array that
      can intereact with all variables required. Learning to not rely on switch
      statements. Running conditions to each element of an array. I also have
      tried my hands on SCSS which I am now interested in mastering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Addtionally, "Project" tab at the top should drop down menu as well, which
      was interesting to produce.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over all, I created this project because I disliked doing mental math when
      playing online Black Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are interested in my Portfolio, it will be under "Project" tab up
      top!
